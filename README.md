# Card game
This is a card game for 2 players.
Each card shows a number from 1 to 10. Each number is in the deck four times for a total of 40 cards. At the
beginning of the game, the deck is shuffled to make sure it is in a random order.
Each player receives a stack of 20 cards from the shuffled deck as their draw pile. 
The draw pile is kept facedown in front of the player. Each player also keeps a discard pile.
Each turn, both players draw the top card. If there are no more cards in the draw pile, shuffle the discard pile
and use those cards as the new draw pile. Once a player has no cards in either their draw or discard pile, that
player loses.
The players present their drawn card and compare the values. The player with the higher value card, takes
both cards and adds them to their discard pile, next to the draw pile. If the cards show the same value, the
winner of the next turn wins these cards as well.
